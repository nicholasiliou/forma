This folder contains a static, self-contained demo build of "Forma" — an interactive 3D data visualization that links simulated workout activity with music listening data.

- Purpose: a privacy-safe demo of the project (all dataset files included here are synthetic/sample data and do not contain personal information).
- Contents: `index.html`, `assets/`, `data/`, and `models/` (the site and its supporting files are bundled for direct hosting).
- Notes: the demo preserves the visualization and interactivity (character model, muscle visualizations, and music-workout mappings) but uses generated example data.
